# Analysis of hacker news headlines

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a news feed with content created by users. Each headline or story gets upvoted by users themselves, and those with the highest upvotes move to the top of the news feed for better visibility. In this project, using several python modules and algorithms I've analyzed different aspects of the hacker news headlines data.
